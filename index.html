						In January 2018, I was working for the History Department, and one of our faculty members, Dan Smail, was preparing for a course called Deep History. This course, cross-listed between anthropology and history, attempts to bridge the gap between the recent past usually studied by historians and the distant past usually studied by archaeologists by focusing on material culture. That is to say, they look at people's stuff, because people have always had stuff, and you can learn a lot from looking at it.

						This focus on material culture led the course to collaborate with the Peabody Museum and other museums on campus. Initially, they had planned for the students to view Peabody Museum objects only in person in section. However, an opportunity arose to work with the Dean of Undergraduate Education to purchase a 3D scanner, so that students in the course would be able to view the objects virtually outside of section as well.

						That's where I enter the picture. As the department's digital scholarship facilitator, I was the one who took responsibility for the scanner, and for figuring out how best to use it. I started with some scans of things I had around my office.

						This was one of the first objects that I scanned, which was pretty easy to scan, since it's mostly plastic and rubber, which show up quite well on the scanner. I want to take a look at this model, to go over some things about the models that we create that aren't always obvious, but still rarely explained. The first thing I want to do is define what I'm talking about when I'm talking about a 3D model. We have this nice thing that we can view from any angle, but it's fundamentally made up of polygons. If I go into the model inspector here, I can show you the polygons that make up this model. You'll notice that there are no gaps between polygons. This is what's called a "watertight" model, and it's necessary for 3d printing the model. Those polygons are colored by the model's texture, which is just a basic image file that has some instructions for how it's supposed to map to the polygons. Here's another tool in the inspector that can help us see that. So when we're trying to create one of these models, we're trying to get an accurate geometry and an accurate texture. Now let's talk about how we get there.

						Here's a video to contextualize what I'm going to be talking about. It's the whole process for a single, pretty simple object, an old wooden alphabet block that I picked up from an antique store.
						(during video): So to start with, we have the block on a piece of paper on a turntable. It's on paper because it shows up better than the glossy wood surface, which makes scanning easier. You can see the preview of the scan with the gridlines representing the base on which the object sits. The software will automatically remove that base, which is why we want it to show up. I've taken two scans of the object, one after flipping it over, so that I have a view of the entire object. With those scans complete, I can see a preview. they're not lined up to each other yet, and they look messy, but they clean up well, I promise. Aligning is a pretty simple process, I just pick out three points that are the same on each scan, and the software does the rest. With that done, I run an algorithm to line up scan frames, then start fusing the scan into a proper mesh. The mesh comes out nicely, with only one tiny gap. The mesh has no coloring to it, so then we add a texture, and there you have it, a complete model.
						So there four main parts of creating a 3d model with this setup: scanning the object, cleaning up and aligning the scans, turning the scans into a mesh, and then texturing the mesh.

						I also scanned my Radiotopia challenge coin, which maybe if you also listen to 99% Invisible you will  think is cool. This was a difficult object to scan, because you can't scan it flat, or the software has no way of knowing how to line up the two sides of the coin. The coin needs to be vertical so that it's possible to get the whole thing. The scanner can also lose track of the object when moving around the coin edge, so it needs something else in its field of view to use as a reference. The scanner is basically taking a whole lot of snapshots of the object, so it needs enough information in each snapshot to figure out where it fits in. Having a background with a complex, non-repeating background is really useful for this, because it ensures that each snapshot has enough information to line it up with the next. To keep this coin vertical, I used a small stand, which I later edited out of the scans with the scanning software.

						Scanning random objects from my office is one thing, I don't have to worry about preserving them for future generations, and I don't have anything super breakable. Scanning museum objects presents some more difficulty, making it really important for me to work with museum conservators to safely scan more precious objects.

						This was one of the first objects that I scanned, and the first one used in the class. Archaeologists call it a fibula, but that's just a fancy word for a fancy pin. This one was mostly easy to scan, except for the back. That was difficult to pick up because it's mostly glass. You may not have guessed that from looking at it, because the glass has yellow paint underneath to make it look yellow, and you'll remember that our models are just meshes of triangles wrapped in an image. Reproducing glass involves reproducing how light interacts with glass, which requires additional degrees of 3D artistry that go beyond simple scanning.

						This object, an Aztec stone knife, was difficult to scan because of the condition of the object. You might notice that this is basically a sharp rock shoved into stick, so it's very possible that it could fall apart if handled improperly. Less obvious is the fact that the gunk on the handle comes off a bit just about any time the knife is handled. That gunk is important, because it's not known what it is, so if it all falls off because we keep moving it to scan it, then what exactly that gunk is may remain a mystery forever. I wasn't handling any of the museum objects myself, but this one could only be handled by the head conservator of the Peabody. It also couldn't just sit on the turntable that I used; it had to sit cradled in a special stand that the head conservator made for it. All of the objects required some padding or cushioning, but not everything required a special stand.

						Another object that required a custom stand was this riding whip. All of the other objects that I've talked about have been rigid, so you can pick them up and flip them over and they won't change shape. This riding whip, however, does not share that property. If I were to scan it just resting on my turntable, I wouldn't be able to scan the underside without rearranging it, and my software couldn't reconstruct it. To get around that, the head conservator at the Peabody rigged up a stand to suspend the whip, so that I could move the scanner all the way around it, getting a view from every angle, without moving the whip itself.

						More recently, I've been scanning objects from the Harvard Art Museum, also for a faculty project the t focuses on material culture. This is an object that was easier to scan with this scanner than it would have been with other kinds of scanners. The scanner that I use only uses faint LED light to project its pattern onto the object in addition to its LED strobe lights. There are other scanners that use lasers instead of LEDs to scan objects, and even traditional photography usually involves bright spot lighting. This presents a problem for fabrics, which are likely to fade faster under strong lights or lasers. Over the long years that an item like this might be in a museum collection, that kind of fading can become a serious problem. The low-impact lighting of this scanner avoids that problem entirely. This is also an object that doesn't get flipped over often, because doing so might damage it. However, the conservator that I was working with was able to flip it for us so that I could scan both sides. We didn't have a special rig to hold this object up, but I was able to line up the two scans from each side manually to create this model.

							When the History Department got its scanner, the Harvard Semitic Museum (Semitic as in the language family that includes classical Hebrew, Classical Arabic, and Egyptian) acquired its own scanner, also an Artec Space Spider. Having full access to their own collections, they were able to scan many objects and also decided to make the models available under creative commons licenses, which is why I was able to print some of their models to share with you today.

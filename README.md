These are the presentation slides for my HUIT Tuesday Tech Talk on 3D scanning.
I'm using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), which is a pretty
rad way to do slide presentations.

The slides are live online at [jaguillette.github.io/tuesday-tech-3d](https://jaguillette.github.io/tuesday-tech-3d/)
